# ðŸ›• Konark Cluster

*Konark* is developed as part of the [PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low Power) project](https://pulp-platform.org/), a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## Getting started (currently in early development)

### Environment setup for IIS-members

For IIS-members, the environment can be set up by sourcing the `iis-env.sh` script:

```bash
source iis-env.sh
```

This will set up all environment variables, and install the virtual python environment, which is needed to generate the RTL and SW sources.

### Environment setup for non-IIS members

For non-IIS members, there is some additional setup required to get the environment up and running.

#### Bender

The first requirement you need to install is `bender`. Check the [installation page](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) on how to set it up.

#### Virtual Python environment

You need to have a python>=3.11 installed, in order to create the virtual python environment:

```bash
make python-venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

By default, it will use the `python` in your `$PATH`. If you want to use a specific python version, you can set the `BASE_PYTHON` environment variable accordingly.

#### Toolchains

* Snitch software tests require the Clang compiler extended with Snitch-specific instructions. There are some precompiled releases available on the [PULP Platform LLVM Project](https://github.com/pulp-platform/llvm-project/releases/download/0.12.0/riscv32-pulp-llvm-ubuntu2004-0.12.0.tar.gz) fork that are ready to be downloaded and unzipped.

Once LLVM is obtained, export a `LLVM_BINROOT` environment variable to the binary folder of the LLVM toolchain installation:

```bash
export LLVM_BINROOT=/path/to/llvm/bin
```

#### Verible (Optional)

For automatic formatting of generated sources, install [`verible`](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible). By default, the Makefile will look for a `verible-verilog-format` in your path, but you can also set it explicitly with the `VERIBLE_FMT` environment variable. This dependency is optional for normal users, but it is required to contribute to the project, since the CI will use verible to check the formatting of the code. Once installed, you can format the SV code in this repository with:

```bash
make verible-fmt
```

### RTL code generation

After setting up the environment, you can generate all the RTL code for the Konark cluster by running:

```bash
make all
```

or to just build/clean just the snitch cluster:
```bash
make sn-rtl
make sn-clean-rtl
```

### Compile software tests

To compile the software for the snitch cluster, you can run the following commands:

```bash
make sw
```

or more selectively:

```bash
make sn-tests
```

### Additional help

Additionally, you can run the following command to get a list of all available commands:

```bash
make help
```
